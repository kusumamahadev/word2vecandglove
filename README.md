📊 AI-Driven Sentiment Classification for E-Commerce Reviews
📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive sentiment classification model for an e-commerce platform specializing in electronic gadgets.
With a 200% increase in customer base over three years and a 25% spike in feedback volume, manual review of customer opinions is no longer scalable.
The solution leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to automatically classify customer feedback (Positive, Negative, Neutral), enabling the business to:
Improve customer experience
Detect and resolve complaints faster
Protect brand reputation
Drive data-informed product decisions
📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer feedback from product reviews, surveys, and social media.
Column Name	Type	Description
Product ID	String/Int	Unique identifier assigned to each product
Product Review	Text	Customer feedback containing opinions, experiences, and insights about the product
Sentiment	Categorical	Labeled sentiment: Positive, Negative, or Neutral
🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Python 🐍
Libraries:
Data Processing: pandas, numpy
NLP: nltk, spacy, scikit-learn
Modeling: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Optional: Deep Learning with TensorFlow / PyTorch
🔎 Approach
Data Preprocessing
Clean and normalize text (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
Tokenize and vectorize reviews using TF-IDF / Word2Vec.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Sentiment distribution across products.
Frequent words in positive vs negative reviews.
Model Building
Train multiple ML models.
Optimize hyperparameters with cross-validation.
Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
Model Deployment (Future Scope)
Deploy via Flask/FastAPI for real-time predictions.
Integrate with dashboards for customer sentiment tracking.
📈 Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.
Precision: % of predicted positives that are correct.
Recall: % of actual positives correctly identified.
F1-Score: Balance between Precision and Recall.
Confusion Matrix: Visual performance analysis.
